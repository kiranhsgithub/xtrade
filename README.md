## Target Audience
The main target audience are people who want to sell their used goods. Our application is seller driven as most of the control is in the hands of the seller. A seller can either accept or reject the bids of his prospective buyers. Our app also targets the people who want to sell their services, like cleaning service, laundry service etc. The sellers are also a main source of income for our business, which is explained in the monetization section.
A niche segment is also served by our web service. The online portals and businesses can access our web service and get the data of our products.

## Monetization
Our service is relatively new and there is a lot of competetion. So we are not aiming at generating any profits initially. However, some money would be drawn from a paid functionality called as 'premium user'.
When a premium user posts an Ad, his Ad is shown at the top of the search results so that he can reach more number of prospective buyers. A small amount would be charged for premium users annually. They can make the payment via paypal or bank transfer to the specified account number.
We have exposed our web service for use by businesses/individual users. This is provided for free as when other businesses use our web service and access the data of our goods, it can increase our sales tremendously and also increase the popularity of the website, leading to indirect cash flow.
